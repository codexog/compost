;; All of these things are function objects.
;; It is complete folly to define a type for all of them.
;; For the lazy ones all that is needed is an execution wrapper.
;; The fast proof of concept version is something like a multimethod
;; that dispatches on the type of the arguments,
;; or one that just assumes everything is a map and uses the domain protocol...
;; the latter is actually ridiculously easy to implement.
